# Tomaat

My first paired project alongside Khalil Najjar. We designed and developed a **mobile-first** web app to help you find a recipe based on cusine preferences, diets and allergies.

## Getting Started

To find your next favourite recipe simply head to...

http://tomaat-app.herokuapp.com/

After doing so, you will need to make an account and set up your preferences.
Click **Decide** to specify a wealth of different filters for your recipe.
Click **Discover** to be given a randomly generated receipe based on your account preferences.

To check out the code, run...

```
$ git clone https://github.com/knajjars/tomaat-app.git
$ cd tomaat-app/
$ npm i
$ touch .env
```

At this point you will have to add the following line into the .env file

```
PORT=3000
```

The api credentials are of course not available. Run the following line to play around with all non-api dependent functionality.

```

$ npm run dev
```
